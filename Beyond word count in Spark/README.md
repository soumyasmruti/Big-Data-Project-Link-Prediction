README
========

1. Run the run.sh shell script. It will automatically run the individual programs

2. If you encounter any issues with approach 1, then run the two individual files
  assignment1BigData.py
  
  Also there is an ipython file with the same name as above you can run that as well.

3. While executing the script in either of the ways kindly make sure you  
are executing the script from the folder which has the input folders for the second question(scrubbed/1880s-all-female-male-scrubbed/), as the file paths in our code are relative to the folder and not absolute.

Since the folder size is huge and cannot be sent as part of the canvas submission, kindly copy our scripts from our folder and execute it in the folder where you have the 451 files 
for the second question and the Sherlock.txt file.

In case you have any other problems with the script, you can contact us at the
below email:
