README
=======

1. There are two parts in this assignment and we have coded different 
approaches for both of the parts. Hence you will have a total of 7 python files
in the folder named "Final"

2. All the individual python files take files from the input folders given and
the paths are relative to where the folder is placed. So when 
you are running our programs, either have the folder structure like how we had it
or kindly change the file path in the individual files which you 
are running.

Folder structure is as follows:

Assignment 2

The folders a2data and a2_graphs are currently not there in the submission 
owing to the file size submission via Canvas. So kindly copy paste 
the folders into our directory.
