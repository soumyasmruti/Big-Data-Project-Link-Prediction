How to push files to github from Windows ?

1. Clone the project repo by issuing the following command:

All of this would work provided you have correctly set up github account on terminal. To do that, issue the following commands:
git config --global user.name "soumyasmruti"
git config --global user.email "<email id associated with that github account>"


Now Type the following command in your git terminal or git GUI if you are using any tool in Windows. On MAC you need not do anything.
Simply go to the terminal and type this command.

git clone https://github.com/AnirudhNarasimhamurthy/Big-Data---Link-Prediction-for-Hotel-Reviews.git

2. Once you have cloned the repository, cd to that directory.

3. Copy paste all the necessary files into that directory.

4. From the terminal issue the following commands to push them into github repo:

git add <filename> or git add * (This will add all the files in the directory every single time)

git commit  -m "Commit message"

git push
